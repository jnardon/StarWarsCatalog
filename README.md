# Star Wars Catalog

This is an app made as a tecnhical test to Accera.

## Architecture

I decided to do the simple. Applying MVC architecture in this app, in my opinion was the best solution.
Since it is not such an big application, and MVC is a very well know architecture by mobile developers.

## Missing Features
* Unit Tests
* UI Tests
* Error treatments

## Built With

* [Realm](https://realm.io) - Local Data Persitence
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - HTTPClient
* [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - Load images from web

# UI Concepts

I tried to use [Material Design Guideline](https://material.io/guidelines/) the most i could. Sometimes it is really hard as a developer to do so. But I figured out this was the easiest and the safiest guideline I was able to use.
